\section{Coursework}
The aim of this coursework is to give you the opportunity to think more about applications of ODE's and give you the freedom to follow your interest.

Your task is as follows:
Imagine that you are the teacher of this course.
Considering any application involving ODE's of your choice, create a short document explaining to your students about the application and how ODE's are involved.
Create one or two challenges for your peers to test their understanding of the topic after reading your document.
You may use ODE mathematics that have been covered in the course, or you may use something new.
Points will be awarded on the basis of demonstration of knowledge, quality and depth of analysis and explanation, accuracy and suitable level of pitch.

Guidance:

\textbf{1)} Please include equations, figures and references as appropriate. Especially references.

\textbf{2)} Create 1-2 challenges to accompany your report, so someone reading your document can test their knowledge.

\textbf{3)} Include \textbf{fully worked} solutions to challenges you make (ie, not only the final answer, but clearly show the steps involved in order to achieve the final answer).

\textbf{4)} Pitch the document at a level where your peers in class can read and understand it. This is important because we may use the reports as a basis for study in the final class.

\textbf{5)} Aim for 2-3 pages in length, including references and challenge questions. The maximum allowed length is 4 pages, excluding worked solutions to your challenges. Your worked-solutions may cover as many pages as you require in order to explain the calculation steps required.

\subsection{Submission}
You must submit \textbf{both a paper and electronic version}. Submit the materials by \textbf{email} to the teacher by \textbf{10:00 on 26 January 2018} with the subject ``[ODE] Coursework'' and \textbf{bring a paper copy to the class on that day}.

The electronic version may be in any format, including LibreOffice, MS Word, Google docs, Latex, etc\ldots If you submit a PDF, please also submit the source-files used to generate the PDF.

Late submission:\\
By 10:00 on 27 January 2018 (electronic submission only): 90\% of the final mark.\\
By 10:00 on 2 February 2018: 50\% of the final mark.\\
Later submissions cannot be considered.

Good luck.
