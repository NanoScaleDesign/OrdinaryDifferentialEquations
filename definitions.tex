\section{Identifying linear and non-linear differential equations}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
Being able to identify linear and non-linear ODE's will help you understand how to approach different problems.

Generally speaking, the differential equation is linear if the functions and orders of the differentials are linear. For example, 

\begin{equation*}
    y'' - 4yx = ln x - y
\end{equation*}
can be shown to be linear. Rearranging to collect all the $y$-terms together:
\begin{equation*}
    y'' - 4yx + y = ln x
\end{equation*}
the dependent variable $y$ and its derivatives are each of the first degree and depend only on a constant or the independent variable.

An example of a non-linear equation however would be
\begin{equation*}
    5 + yy' = x - y
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation*}
    yy' + y = x - 5
\end{equation*}
The fact that $y'$ is multiplied by $y$ results in a non-linear equation in $y$.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Sum the points corresponding to the equations that are linear. Be sure to clearly justify your choices of linear or non-linear equations.

1 point: $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt} = 5t^3 + 3$.

2 points: $\displaystyle cos(y) y'''(t) - y(t) = 25$.

4 points: $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dt} \frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = \frac{t^{-2}}{3}$.

8 points: $\displaystyle y'(t) - sin(y(t)) = 0$.

16 points: $\displaystyle y'(t) - y(t) = 0$.

32 points: $\displaystyle t y'(t) - y(t) = 0$.
