What is the sum of the orders of the following equations?

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dy}{dx}A = 5x^3 + 3

\subsection*{Comment}
Using a function $x$ dependent on time $t$ as an example, a differential equation is defined as being linear if it can be written in the form

\begin{equation}
    f_n(t) \frac{d^nx}{d t^n} + \dots + f_1(t) \frac{dx}{dt} + f_0(t) x + f_c(t) = C
\end{equation}

Here, $f_n(t)$ is a function of time only, such as $5t$ or $2/t^2$ or may even be constant with time (eg, $3$).
Any of the $f_n$'s and the constant $C$ may be zero.
If it is possible to arrange an equation into the above form, then the equation must be linear.
So for a linear equation, $x(t)$, $x'(t)$, $t x(t)$, $3t^2 x'''(t)$ are linear terms in $x$, but $x(t)^2$, $x(t) x'(t)$ and $5 t Tan(x)$ are non-linear terms.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Sum the points corresponding to the equations that are linear:

1 point: $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = 5t^3 + 3$.

2 points: $\displaystyle cos(x) x'''(t) - x(t) = 25$.

4 points: $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dt} \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = \frac{t^{-2}}{3}$.

8 points: $\displaystyle x'(t) - sin(x(t)) = 0$.

16 points: $\displaystyle x'(t) - x(t) = 0$.

32 points: $\displaystyle t x'(t) - x(t) = 0$.
