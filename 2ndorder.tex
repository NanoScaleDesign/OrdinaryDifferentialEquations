\subsection*{Challenge}
2nd-order differential equations deal with oscillations.

Considering Hooke's law, what are $A$ and $C$ in the following equation?
\begin{equation}
    A x'' + C x = 0
\end{equation}

To check your answer, substitute a mass of \SI{2}{kg} and spring-constant of \SI{3}{kg/s^2} as appropriate.

\subsection*{Solution}
Enter only numerical values without units such as kg.

\section{Characteristic equation: understanding}

\subsection*{Resources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Book (\url{http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/getfile.aspx?file=B,1,N}) from page 111.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
A homogeneous (ie, equal to zero) second-order differential equation typically takes the form:

\begin{equation}
    A \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + B \frac{dy}{dt} + C y = 0
\end{equation}

The first (A) term describes acceleration, while the third (C) term is the force-constant term (something like the ``stiffness'' of the spring). The second (B) term could describe a frictional force that is proportional to the velocity ($dy/dt$). Due to its relation with oscillation (and by extension, sines and cosines which can be expressed in terms of exponentials) we can typically assume an exponential-form solution to the differential equation.

\subsection*{Challenge}
Show that, assuming that all solutions to a 2nd-order differential equation of the form above will have solutions $y(t)=e^{rt}$, the value of $r$ can in principle be determined by solving the following a quadratic equation of the form
\begin{equation}
    A r^2 + Br + C = 0
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Solution}
If you are unsure of your derivation, please ask someone.
