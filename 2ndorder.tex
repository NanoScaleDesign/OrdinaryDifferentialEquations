Second-order differential equations deal with oscillations. Here we consider harmonic oscillation of a spring. The aim of this challenge is to give you the opportunity to think about how the terms of a 2nd-order ODE relate to force and stiffness in the context of a spring.

Equation \ref{eq:hooke} is a fundamental equation of mechanics describing oscillatory motion such as the spring here. Hooke's law states that the force leading to acceleration of the mass $m$ is proportional to the stretching distance $x$. The proportionality constant is Hooke's constant, $k$.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:hooke}
    m x'' + k x = 0
\end{equation}
or alternatively
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:hooke2}
    m x'' = -k x
\end{equation}

This leads to perfectly oscillating motion,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:oscillation}
     x(t)=\cos(\omega t)
\end{equation}
which oscillates forever since there is no damping term.

\subsection*{Challenge}
By considering the oscillatory motion (equation \ref{eq:oscillation}) as a solution of the 2nd-order differential equation given by Hooke's law (equations \ref{eq:hooke} and \ref{eq:hooke2}), determine the oscillation frequency $\omega$ in terms of the mass and spring constant.

\subsection*{Solution}
To check your answer, calculate the oscillation frequency for a harmonic spring with a mass of \SI{2}{kg} and spring-constant of \SI{4}{kg/s^2}. Only enter numbers, without any units, in your answer.

\subsection*{Resources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Book (\url{http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/getfile.aspx?file=B,1,N}) from page 106.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
It is possible to add a damping term $B$ to Hooke's law that is proportional to the velocity of the movement. You could imagine this as a friction term, with the force from friction becoming stronger as the velocity increases.

\subsection*{Challenge}
\begin{equation}
    A \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + B \frac{dy}{dt} + C y = 0
\end{equation}

Show that, assuming that all solutions to a 2nd-order differential equation of the form above will have solutions $y(t)=e^{rt}$, the value of $r$ can in principle be determined by solving the following a quadratic equation of the form
\begin{equation}
    A r^2 + Br + C = 0
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Solution}
If you are unsure of your derivation, please ask someone.

\emph{(Note that if you encounter a square-root during your calculations such as $\sqrt{7}$, it is best to work with $\sqrt{7}$ rather than $2.65$ in order to maintain accuracy until the final step where you need to evaluate it. If the equation becomes too messy (eg $e^{(\sqrt{7}-1)/\sqrt{3}}$) you can always substitute $m=(\sqrt{7}-1)/\sqrt{3}$, etc, to make things clearer.)}
