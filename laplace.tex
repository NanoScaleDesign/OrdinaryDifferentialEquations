\section{Your first Laplace Transform calculations}

\subsection*{Resources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Videos: The four Khan-academy videos starting at \url{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations/laplace-transform/laplace-transform-tutorial/v/laplace-transform-1}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comment}
The Laplace Transform is a powerful technique that has many uses beyond solving ODE's. It can however appear a bit abstract at first. Becoming comfortable with controlling and manipulating the transform will help provide confidence when using it to solve ODE's. The four videos in the resources above provide an excellent starting point for getting you comfortable with this powerful technique.

\subsection*{Challenge}
1. Calculate $\lap\{1\}$

2. Calculate $\lap\{at\}$

3. Calculate $\lap\{Cos(at)\}$

\subsection*{Solution}
To check your answer, substitute $s=1$ and $a=2$ into your final solution.

1. 1

2. 2

3. $\frac{1}{5}$

\subsection*{Challenge}
1. Calculate $\displaystyle \frac{d^3}{dt^3} \left( t e^{a t} \right)$

2. Given
\begin{equation}
    \lap\{t e^{a t}\} = \frac{1}{(a-s)^2}
\end{equation}
determine $\lap\{3a^2 e^{at} + a^3te^{at}\}$

\subsection*{Solution}
To check your answer, substitute $s=1$ and $a=2$ into your final solution.
