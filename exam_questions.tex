\section{Questions about the final exam}

Will the final exam cover the entire course or only the course content between the mid-term exam and the end of the course?

\emph{The final exam will cover the entire course.}

Do we need to memorise formulae like that for the Runge-Kutta method?

\emph{The aim is to test understanding rather than the ability to memorise formulae. So if you need to use the Runge-Kutta method I will supply the forumula for it. That said, you will need to remember basic methods that are fundamental to the basis of solving ODE's, such as the characteristic solutions to 2nd-order differential equations.}

Will it be stated if we should use method X or method Y to solve an ODE?

\emph{If it doesn't specifically state how to solve a problem, then you're welcome to use whatever method you find easiest. If it states how you should solve a problem then you should use the method indicated.}
